# WePi

[WePi](https://wepi.soical) aim to create a social media platform in which Pioneers have the freedom to communicate and share any concerns related to Pi Network world as a whole. Posts and comments in our platform will be ranked based upon upvotes/downvotes from everyone. Users can also use Pi Token to tip posts that they feel most interested in. The fund will be fully transferred to the account of the writers. Users will take full control of their power and advantages from our platform. There won't be any centralized means existing in our homeland. We will only exert automatic filters to remove profanity, sexual content, children abuse, etc... Other than that, people have their own right to express their thoughts and ideas.

[WePi](https://wepi.soical) is forked from [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy), a similar to sites like [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): you subscribe to forums you're interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse.

For a link aggregator, this means a user registered on one server can subscribe to forums on any other server, and can have discussions with users registered elsewhere.

It is an easily self-hostable, decentralized alternative to Reddit and other link aggregators, outside of their corporate control and meddling.

Each [WePi](https://wepi.soical) server can set its own moderation policy; appointing site-wide admins, and community moderators to keep out the trolls, and foster a healthy, non-toxic environment where all can feel comfortable contributing.
